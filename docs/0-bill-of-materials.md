# Bill of materials

## Notes about the microcontroller

This project is intended to be cheap and accesible, and it is based on the microcontroller Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Please don't confuse it with the similarly named Arduino Nano 33 BLE :)

In addition, it is sold with and without headers. We recommend acquiring the one ***with headers*** so you can immediately start using it on a breadboard without needing to solder the headers on it.

## Minimum materials

These materials are necessary for all Tiny Trainable Instruments
