NOTE: Make sure you purchase the correct board, Arduino Nano 33 BLE ***Sense***! Please don't confuse it with the similarly named Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

In addition, this board is sold with and without headers. We recommend acquiring the one ***with headers*** so you can immediately start using it on a breadboard without needing to solder the headers on it.
